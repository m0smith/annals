;; EMACS task based session manager and developer notebook with ideas similar to (mylyn) for eclipse.

;; When working in a task, such as a Jira issue, it would be nice to keep the state of EMACS, including non-file buffers like *shell*. EMACS desktop.el already does this. In addition, I would like to:

;;     Optionally save the contents of earmuff buffers (*shell*, *grep*, etc), keeping a version per session (gh-1) (annals-buffer-name-create)
;;     Manage a directory of desktops based on task name or JIRA issue id or github issue id (annals-task)
;;     Integerate with org-mode task switching, clock in, clock out, etc.
;;     Integerate with dir-mode by adding keystrokes to use a dir as a desktop (gh-3)
;;     Create a jounal file for each task called annals.org. The name is controlled by annals-file-name-default.
;;     Easily switch tasks (annals-task)
;;     Allow multiple tasks to be active at the same time. Buffers can belong to one or more active tasks.

;; Of course it would rely heavily upon the built in desktop functionality.

;; Installation and Configuration

;; Clone the repo from https://github.com/m0smith/annals. The following instructions assume it is in ~/projects. Add to your .emacs:

;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/annals")
;;   (load "annals")

;;   (global-set-key [f6] (quote annals-task))
;;   (global-set-key [C-f6] (quote annals-buffer-name-create))

;; To automatically have a type of non-file buffer associated with the current task, add annals-buffer-name-create to the mode hook like:

;;   (add-hook 'sql-login-hook 'annals-buffer-name-create)

;; Basic Tasks

;; Start a new task (annals-task)

;;     The user gives the task a name and it is created in a
;;     subdirectory of annals-active-directory. It becomes the current
;;     task and any new buffers will belong to it. Creates an
;;     annals.org in the task directory. If the task id matches a Jira
;;     issue or github issue, pull information from that issue into
;;     the annals.org.

;; Suspend a task (annals-suspend)

;;     Do the same as desktop-save and desktop-clear. In addition,
;;     save off the state of interesting non-file buffers.

;; Resume a task (annals-task)

;;     Do the same as desktop-read. Do not reload the non-file buffers.

;; Archive a task (annals-archive)

;;     Move the task to the annals-archive-directory. If the task was active, suspend it first.

;; Save the state of active tasks and keep them all active (annals-checkpoint)

;;     Same as desktop-save on all the active tasks. In addition, save
;;     the associated non-file buffers. Running annals-task without
;;     changing the task will also perform a checkpoint.

;; Associate a non-file buffer to be saved as part of the annal (annals-buffer-name-create)

;; Dired Mode Integration

;; A minor mode exists for for the active directory and the archive directory to manage the tasks.

;; When in dired-mode for the annals-active-directory (default
;; ~/annals), a new minor mode that adds some annals functionality
;; with the following bindings:

;;     |a - annals-dired-task Activate the task on the current line
;;     |z - annals-dired-archive Archive the task on the current line
;;     |i - annals-dired-info Display the summary info for the current task

;; When in dired-mode for the annals-archive-directory (default
;; ~/annals/.archive), a new minor mode that adds some annals
;; functionality with the following bindings:

;;     |z - annals-dired-unarchive Unarchive the task on the current line
;;     |i - annals-dired-info Display the summary info for the current task

;; Hooks

;; annals-task-hook Run after the task has been initialized or
;; switched. The current task id will be in the variable
;; annals-active-task-id.

;; annals-create-file-hook Run when the annals.org file needs to be
;; created for a task. The function should accept 2 parameters:
;; task-id and file-name and return the file-name or nil if it did not
;; create the file. The file file-name will not exist when the
;; function is called. The functions in the list will be called until
;; one returns non-nil, meaning it actually created a file.

;; Jira Integration

;; If the task id looks like a Jira ID (letters-digits) and
;; annals-jira-server is set to the URL of a jira server, then
;; annals.org will have a link to the Jira issue and will also pull in
;; the issue summary.

;; Github Integration

;; If the task id looks like a Jira ID (repo-project-digits like
;; m0smith-annals-1) and annals-github-api-server is set to the URL of
;; the (Github API server), then annals.org will have a link to the
;; Github issue and will also pull in the issue summary.
